[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7137950a-0d4a-4788-bdb0-72c76bba1aa8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/xiosman/deploys)

This is my personal site built with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) and hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).


## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install the Gridsome CLI**

   ```sh
   npm install --global @gridsome/cli
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```sh
   gridsome develop
   ```

## Building for Production

In addition to the development server started with `gridsome develop`, you can also generate a full static production build:

```sh
gridsome build
```

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories in this project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── static
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── gridsome.config.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md

1. **`/node_modules`**: The directory where all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2. **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser), like your site header, or a page template. “Src” is a convention for “source code”.

3. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4. **`gridsome.config.js`**: This file contains configuration and options for installed plugins. (Check out the [config docs](https://gridsome.org/docs/config) for more detail).

5. **`LICENSE`**: This project is licensed under the MIT license.

6. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly).

7. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

8. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
